# Credit-Risk-Modelling
## Introduction to Machine Learning Assessment


#### Background
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a loan 
<br>applicant is likely to default or not and assist the bank in determining which loan applications to approve 
<br>and which ones to reject based on the data of the applicant. The model takes into consideration factors that affect 
<br>an applicantâ€™s ability to repay the loan such as  demographic information, financial history, employment status, credit score, 
<br>loan amount, etc., and predicts the likelihood of loan default. The model will be created with at least 4 different algorithms, 
<br>each algorithm critically evaluated and measured, and the best performing algorithm selected. The bank wants to limit losses that arise 
<br>because of providing loans to applicants who do not meet the criteria of its creditworthiness as well as risks  with lending to high-risk, 
<br>default-prone applicants..
