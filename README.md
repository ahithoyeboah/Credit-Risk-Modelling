#### Background
##### Introduction
Credit risk assessment plays a vital role in financial institutions to evaluate the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their loan obligations. With the advent of machine learning and advanced statistical techniques, it has become possible to leverage data-driven approaches to predict credit risk more accurately. This project focuses on using Python for credit risk analysis, encompassing feature engineering, ANOVA, and chi-square tests to identify significant predictors and build a robust credit risk model.

##### Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based credit risk analysis model using 4 different machine learning algorithms that can effectively predict the likelihood of default for borrowers. By utilizing feature engineering techniques and conducting statistical tests such as ANOVA and chi-square, we aim to identify the most informative features and uncover potential relationships between these features and credit risk.

##### Methods

Feature Engineering:
Exploring and understanding the available credit risk dataset, which may include various attributes such as borrower information, loan details, financial indicators, and historical credit data.
Conducting data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Creating new features by leveraging domain knowledge, transforming existing variables, or combining multiple attributes to capture additional information relevant to credit risk.
ANOVA and Chi-Square Tests:

Performing ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests to identify statistically significant differences in means between different groups of categorical features and the target variable (default/non-default).
Conducting chi-square tests to assess the association between categorical variables and credit risk.
Selecting features that demonstrate significant statistical relationships with credit risk based on the results of these tests.
Machine Learning Model Development:

Employing a machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression, random forest,decision trees or k-nearest neighbour, to build a predictive model based on the selected features.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training the model on the training data.
Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the ROC curve.
Fine-tuning the model by adjusting hyperparameters and performing cross-validation to enhance its predictive capabilities.

##### Conclusion
This credit risk analysis project showcases the application of feature engineering techniques and statistical tests in developing a machine learning model for credit risk prediction. By leveraging Python's data manipulation capabilities and statistical libraries, we aimed to identify the most relevant predictors and create an accurate credit risk assessment tool. The insights gained from this project can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals and managing credit risk effectively.
